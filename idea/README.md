# IDEA

We are creating an online education platform for better use as students and teachers are/were facing a lot of trouble while attending online classes.

## PRODUCT  NAME - UNICORNTEACH

Saves data consumption and data usage. 

Disconnecting from classes happens way less as there are no huge chunks of
data to be downloaded.

This approach will make “Students who don’t have access to sufficient
bandwidth” also feasible towards online classe


## TECHNOLOGIES WE WILL BE USING

Node.js(Express server in backend), CSS3, HTML5, peerjs, Bootstrap, webRTC, Javascript(Vanilla)
